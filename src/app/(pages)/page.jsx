                      <b>Stimulating hair regrowth with dissolvable threads.</b>
                      “Threads for hair” refers to a treatment where tiny
                      absorbable threads (usually made of PDO – Polydioxanone, a
                      material used in surgical sutures) are inserted into the
                      scalp to combat hair loss. PDO scalp threading, also known
                      as hair threading therapy, is a minimally invasive
                      procedure originally adapted from facial thread lifts. The
                      concept is simple: dozens of very fine threads are placed
                      just under the scalp skin in areas of thinning. These
                      threads create a supportive mesh and cause a controlled
                      “micro-injury” that triggers the body’s healing response.
                      In doing so, they increase blood flow, collagen, and
                      growth factors around hair follicles. Over the next 6–8
                      months, the threads slowly dissolve, but during that time
                      they continuously stimulate the scalp – essentially
                      “tricking” it into rejuvenation mode. The result is
                      stronger, thicker hair growth in those areas. Our clinic
                      performs PDO hair threading using FDA-approved threads and
                      a proprietary technique from Canada to ensure precision
                      and safety. This therapy is an excellent non-surgical hair
